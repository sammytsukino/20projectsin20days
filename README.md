# 🌸 20 Playful Projects in 20 Days (but make it kawaii)

This repo is my take on the classic **"50 Projects in 50 Days"** challenge.  
Instead of 50, I’ll be creating **20 small projects** with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

These aren’t big apps — they’re **tiny, playful, and kinda kawaii experiments** designed to sharpen my frontend skills, explore fun UI ideas, and most importantly:  
✨ **warm up for my second year of DAW** ✨

---

## 🎯 Goals

- 🧩 Practice **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS** (no frameworks, no shortcuts).  
- 🎨 Focus on **cute, playful, aesthetic UIs** (because that’s my brand 💖).  
- 🚀 Build **tiny, self-contained projects** that I can finish in 1–2 days.  
- 📚 Use this repo as a **learning log** and a way to track progress.  

---

## 📂 Structure

Each project lives in its own folder:  

```
.
├── day_1/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
├── day_2/
│   └── ...
...
```

- Every folder = one mini-project.  
- No build tools, no servers — just open `index.html` in your browser.

## 🌸 Project Themes

Expect things like:  
- Interactive buttons ✨  
- Cute loaders 🌸  
- Tiny animations 🎀  
- Playful UI experiments 💅  
- Maybe even some *unnecessary but adorable* extras 💖  

---

## 🖤 Notes

- These are **practice projects**, not polished products.  
- They’ll likely be **short, simple, and a little dramatic**.  
- The goal isn’t perfection — it’s **exploration, fun, and learning**.  

---

## 🏁 Why?

Because before diving into bigger DAW (Web App Development) projects, I want to:  
- Stretch my **JavaScript muscles**.  
- Refine my **frontend styling**.  
- And, honestly… just make cute stuff.
